# SIH-2024: Data-Driven Fertilizer Recommendation System

## Problem Statement

**Create a data-driven solution that recommends optimal fertilizer types and quantities based on soil health, crop type, and weather patterns, ensuring sustainable agricultural practices.**

### Expected Solution

Develop an application that analyzes soil data and provides tailored fertilizer recommendations, promoting sustainable farming while enhancing crop yield and farmer income.

## Motivation

Excessive and improper use of fertilizers has led to soil degradation and declining agricultural productivity, negatively impacting farmers' income and threatening long-term sustainability. To address these challenges, there is a critical need for a data-driven solution that provides personalized fertilizer recommendations based on soil health, crop type, and weather patterns. This solution will:

- **Promote sustainable farming practices.**
- **Enhance crop yields.**
- **Improve farmers' economic stability** by optimizing fertilizer use and reducing unnecessary costs.

## Key Features
